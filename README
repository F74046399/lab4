Question b.
	output:	18
			48
			48
			88
	reason: a character represent 1 bytes in memory
			a integer represent 4 bytes in memory
			a float represent 4 bytes in memory
			a double type represent 8 bytes in memory
			However,The size of a pointer and the size of what it points to are not related. An analogy is to consider them like postal addresses. The size of 
			the address of a house has no relationship to the size of the house. 
			The size of pointer represents the size of space. And the space must be the same,no matter what type is the pointer.
